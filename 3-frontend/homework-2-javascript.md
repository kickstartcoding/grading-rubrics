# Frontend Homework 2: JavaScript

### Rubric

Start with 100, then subtract.

* **Big penalties** (Pick only one)
    * -40 points if does not have any JavaScript
    * -30 points if uses pre-made charting graph
    * -30 points if has JavaScript, but code does not run, or does not
      attempt to use any data
    * -25 points if has JavaScript, but does not display graph with data
    * -10 points if it shows a graph with JavaScript, but does not provide
      any way to transform graph (e.g. shows static graph)

* **Small penalties**
    * -5 points if graph does not accurately display data
    * -5 points if not deployed to github io
    * -5 points if any styles do not load

* **Waivable small penalties**
    * -5-10 points if the way to transform the data is minor or hardcoded
    * -1-5 points if JavaScript is a giant mess
    * -5 points if page is aesthetically very very ugly / actually unusable
    * -5 points if late
    * -5 points if requires button to load data
    * -1-5 points if minor visual defects (e.g. glitchy space, etc)
