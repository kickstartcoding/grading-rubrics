### Rubric

Start with 100, then subtract.

* **Big penalties**
    * -10 points if uses bootstrap OR some pre-made styling (-20 if premade graph)
    * -10 points if does not use any CSS grid OR flexbox
    * -10 points if does not show a graph of data of some sort
    * -10 points if does not have at least 5 style rules

* **Small penalties**
    * -5 points if not deployed to github io
    * -5 points if any styles do not load

* **Waivable small penalties**
    * -1-5 points if grid is used incorrectly such as specifying a grid column repeatedly
    * -5 points if page is aesthetically very very ugly / actually unusable
    * -5 points if late
    * -1-5 points if minor visual defects (e.g. glitchy space, etc)
