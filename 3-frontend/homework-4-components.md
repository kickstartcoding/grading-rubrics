      attempt to use any data
    * -25 points if charting is not contained within its own component (instead of App)
    * -25 points if not using fetch
    * -25 points if has JavaScript, but does not split content into 3 components in addition to App
    * -10 points if does not use proper directory structure

* **Small penalties**
    * -5 points if not deployed to heroku
    * -5 points if any styles do not load
    * -5 points if doesn't use useState or useEffect
    * -5 points if minor JS errors are present

* **Waivable small penalties**
    * -1-5 points if JavaScript is a giant mess
    * -5 points if page is aesthetically very very ugly / actually unusable
    * -5 points if late
    * -1-5 points if minor visual defects (e.g. glitchy space, etc)
